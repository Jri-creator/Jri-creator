**Hi!**

![koala resting in a tree](https://github.com/Jri-creator/Jri-creator/blob/502e09e3e6018e2cad0e39035ddf37a187036159/istockphoto-139995566-612x612.jpg)

I'm Jri-creator, also known as Jri-**C**reator on some other platforms. I mainly work on my websites (you can find the full public list at https://jri.qzz.io) but if I'm on here, I'm doing stuff.

I love koalas. Something about koalas and me, they match quite well sometimes. 

My profile picture on other platforms will either be a picture of a Magnifying Glass like the one on my site, or a koala, or my GitHub Octopus.

Despite my many years of having things and using things, I find that I'm still getting used to things and doing things wrong sometimes. I can't say I speak Git very well, but I'm improving on my Spanish Skill!

While it would be amazing, to be the koala resting in the trees in that photo, I'm still a human with a life. 

If you ever want to reach out, you can either send a **JriMail** (https://jmail.rf.gd) to **Jri-creator**, or you can email me at jri-creator@jri.qzz.io. No, I don't have a public phone number, that's weird.
